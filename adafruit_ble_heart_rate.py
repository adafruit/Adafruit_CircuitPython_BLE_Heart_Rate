BLE Heart Rate Service


* Author(s): Dan Halbert for Adafruit Industries

The Heart Rate Service is specified here:
https://www.bluetooth.com/wp-content/uploads/Sitecore-Media-Library/Gatt/Xml/Services/org.bluetooth.service.heart_rate.xml

Implementation Notes
--------------------

**Hardware:**

* Adafruit CircuitPython firmware for the supported boards:
  https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases
* Adafruit's BLE library: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BLE

.. :attribute:: heart_rate:

        Heart rate (int), in beats per minute.

.. :attribute:: contact:

        ``True`` if device is contacting the body, ``False`` if not,

.. :attribute:: rr_intervals:

        Sequence of RR intervals, measuring the time between
        beats. Oldest first, in ints that are units of 1024ths of a second.
        This sequence will be empty if the device does not report the intervals.
